This project features the backend, written in python and hosted on Render.com, for my Minecraft Biome Scanner website, whose frontend is in Biome-Scanner-Frontend, with the help of Gemini Pro.

I want to build a backend for this website. Currently, everything is in index.html. I want to use Render to host it. What should be my first step?

I would like to use Python for the backend

Before in index.html, I was using config.js to get the keys but now we switched to .env. How do I show that change in index.html and anywhere else?

const res = await fetch('/api/config'); What is this line doing?

Each column of the weather/time statistic is a different size. Can u make it uniform?

The images dont work, but index.html and images are in the same folder, static. What is the issue?

I'm using render, and I got a URL. But only the weather api seems to be working. There is no globe or country detection. How do I debug this?

I created a new key on mapbox and made only render allowed to use it, and now I see the globe. However, it thinks everything I click on is the ocean biome. No countries are appearing.

Now, im wondering what feature can I add to my biome scanner to make it more interactive and cooler? I dont want to add small superficial things, but maybe one big cool thing. Brainstorm some options.

How do I start with adding a game system that tracks new biomes visited?

I just realized the backend and frontend needs to be seperate. I've created two seperate repos for them and moved files around, but what changes do I need to make to app.py so it can communciate with the frontend?

Am I supposed to just see my mapbox key when I open the render URL? Why is that?
