This project features the backend, written in python and hosted on Render.com, for my Minecraft Biome Scanner website, whose frontend is in Biome-Scanner-Frontend, with the help of Gemini Pro.

I want to build a backend for this website. Currently, everything is in index.html. I want to use Render to host it. What should be my first step?

I would like to use Python for the backend

Before in index.html, I was using config.js to get the keys but now we switched to .env. How do I show that change in index.html and anywhere else?

const res = await fetch('/api/config'); What is this line doing?

Each column of the weather/time statistic is a different size. Can u make it uniform?

The images dont work, but index.html and images are in the same folder, static. What is the issue?

I'm using render, and I got a URL. But only the weather api seems to be working. There is no globe or country detection. How do I debug this?

I created a new key on mapbox and made only render allowed to use it, and now I see the globe. However, it thinks everything I click on is the ocean biome. No countries are appearing.

Now, im wondering what feature can I add to my biome scanner to make it more interactive and cooler? I dont want to add small superficial things, but maybe one big cool thing. Brainstorm some options.

How do I start with adding a game system that tracks new biomes visited?

I just realized the backend and frontend needs to be seperate. I've created two seperate repos for them and moved files around, but what changes do I need to make to app.py so it can communciate with the frontend?

Am I supposed to just see my mapbox key when I open the render URL? Why is that?

Can you explain what app.py is doing at each endpoint? How exactly does index.html communicate with it?

I still really like the idea of how geoguessr puts users in a random location. Since it's unfeasible to randomly select coordinates, can I create a database of some sort that preloads known coordinates and selects coordinates from there?

I've created a table with lng, lat, location values, but I do not know how to incorporate sql here

What does it mean to execute, why does it need to be done twice?

I've added an error handling condition but this isn't necessary since we're only polling from the database right?

The coordinates you gave me are not good views for biome guessing and some of them don't exist. I'm going to manually put in my own coords. From there, I can recursively call the triggerRandomDrop function in my frontend if the coords end up not having a streetview. This is fine right since there's only a limited number of coords?
