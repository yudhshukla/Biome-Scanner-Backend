This backend supports the frontend which displays weather and geolocation data in the form of a interactive world globe. It exposes two endpoints, /api/config to provide the Mapbox public token, and /api/scan to retrieve real-time weather and location data based on the latitude and longitude of the clicked location. The frontend receives these endpoints by fetching the URL of the backend. Then, it takes the JSON data that is returned to display the corresponding Minecraft biome. To set up the backend, install everything in requirements.txt and run python3 (or whichever version is on your computer) app.py. To connect the frontend, simply visit the pages link on my Biome-Scanner-Frontend repo. Secrets are handled by placing my two API keys in an .env file which is hidden by .gitignore. These keys are manually provided to the Render environment but hidden from the client.
